# TypeScript

Welcome to the TypeScript directory! Here, I've been learning about TypeScript and how it's used in web development. I've been focusing on converting Express code into TypeScript and exploring concepts like routers, controllers, and modules. Inside, you'll find examples and exercises that teach you the basics of using TypeScript in Express.js projects.

## Routers, Controllers and Model

In TypeScript web development:

- Router: Manages URL routes, directing requests to the appropriate controller methods.

- Controller: Contains logic to handle HTTP requests and generate responses, acting as an intermediary between routes and functionality.

- Model: Represents data structures and defines how data is structured and manipulated within the application. Models are often used to interact with databases or external data sources.
