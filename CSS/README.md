# CSS

Welcome to the CSS directory! This directory contains all the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files used in our project. CSS is a crucial part of web development as it dictates how our web pages look and feel.

## About

Within this directory, I've combined CSS styling with HTML projects to craft web applications that are not only visually captivating but also user-friendly. Each CSS file corresponds to a specific HTML project, illustrating how CSS can elevate ordinary web pages into captivating and elegantly designed interfaces.
