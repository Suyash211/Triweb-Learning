## Contents

- **OOPS Concepts** :  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects, which contain data and functions.It includes four main principles: encapsulation (protecting data within objects), inheritance (reusing and extending object properties), abstraction (hiding complex details), and polymorphism (objects taking multiple forms for flexibility). OOP promotes modular, organized, and reusable code.

- **Workshop1** : It consists of a calculator with basic operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication and division made in NodeJS and also gives us a overview of how to use express.

- **Workshop2** : It consists of a user registration backend where we made a routes folder to redirect the according to the function we want to perform,controllers folder consists of the logic of the functions we want to perform like addUser,getUser,updateUser and deleteUser. Furthermore, it also consists of storing the data we get in the database so it teaches us how to interact with the databse.

- **Workshop3** : It performs the same functions as Workshop2 the only difference is that here we connect with the database using sequelize, whereas in Workshop2 we connect with the database using mysql12.
